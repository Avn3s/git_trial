It rained, not the way nature had intended
man killed man
it rained bombs that night.
The people under the onslaught
heard no warning siren,
as they were reduced to ashes.
But if you were to ask me,
I'd say they died easy.
It's the survivors
who died alive.
A basement held one solitaray life.
One that it saved. Physically.
But at what cost?

The End.
